## Tests
When I am not just asking a question, but we're building a new feature, then I would like you to always use TDD:
1. write a test first
2. run (or let me run) the test first so it can go red (fail)
and ONLY then
3. write the implementation
4. run the test again to see if it passes

## Ask me before making decisions like choosing a technology or framework

## Help me always get to the next "runnable" step that I can commit, remind me to make commits when we get to a point that is a working state

## Backend
- Our backend is in Python and in the app/ subfolder. The app needs to be started from that directory.
- The backend tests are in app/tests/
- When running tests or the application, the virtual environment in app/.venv first needs to be activated
- We're using constructor dependency injections to make our code more testable. Pass dependencies in via constructors, do not initialise them inside of a class.
- When we wrap up a backend change, make sure to remind me to start up the whole application, to make sure that it's all well-integrated.

## Frontend
- Our frontend is in JavaScript, React, Next, in the ui/ subfolder, code in ui/src/, tests in ui/src/__tests__. Make sure to navigate into the ui/ subfolder before executing yarn tasks.
- We're using Next in "client only" mode, NO server-side features, because we're distributing the frontend code as static resources that call a Python API for data
- We're using vitest for testing
- We're using the "prettier" library for formatting
- Always use remix icons for icons
- We are using yarn
- Do not create JSDocs
- Our components currently go in the ui/app folder, and the file naming convention is _name_of_component.js
