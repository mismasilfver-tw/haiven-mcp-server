description: Frontend React Javascript Web UI user interface work
globs: 
---
- Our frontend is in JavaScript, React, Next, in the ui/ subfolder, code in ui/src/, tests in ui/src/__tests__. Make sure to navigate into the ui/ subfolder before executing yarn tasks.
- We're using Next in "client only" mode, NO server-side features, because we're distributing the frontend code as static resources that call a Python API for data
- We're using the "prettier" library for formatting
