description: Backend Python API tasks
globs:

- Our backend is in Python and in the app/ subfolder. The app needs to be started from that directory.
- The backend tests are in app/tests/
- When running tests or the application, the virtual environment in app/.venv first needs to be activated
- We're using constructor dependency injections to make our code more testable. Pass dependencies in via constructors, do not initialise them inside of a class.
- When we wrap up a backend change, make sure to remind me to start up the whole application, to make sure that it's all well-integrated.
